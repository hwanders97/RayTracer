# Raytracer

This is a raytracer that creates realistic images with spheres and planes, reflections, refractions and shadows.


## Running the Program

`cd` into the downloaded directory and run `make` – this will create an executable file named **output**


```
./output 'filename'
```
This will create an image named `filename.png`

## Changing the Image

1. Scene class – create spheres, planes and lights, change camera position and view
2. Material class – diffuse, specular, etc.
