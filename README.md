# Raytracer

This is a raytracer that creates realistic images with spheres and planes, reflections and shadows.


## Running the Program

`cd` into the downloaded directory and run `make` – this will create an executable file name "output"


```
./output 'filename'
```
This will create an image named `'filename.png`

### Changing the Image

1. Read through the Scene class – how to create spheres, planes and lights, change camera position and view
2. Read through the Material class – understand the components of a shape's material (diffuse, specular, etc.)
